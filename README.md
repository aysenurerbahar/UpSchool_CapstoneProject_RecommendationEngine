# UpSchool_CapstoneProject_RecommendationEngine
A recommender system learns from customer's behaviors and recommends products that users most potentially buy. In e-commerce, recommendation systems are frequently used. It is one of the important application area for big data and machine learning. 
In this project, I have developed a recommendation engine and web app by using sales data provided by the projectâ€™s sponsor Trendyol Group. This project mainly consists of two popular recommendation filtering systems: Content-Based and Collaborative.
